      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! I‚Äôm Tahir Ismailwala, a passionate developer and lifelong learner. I‚Äôm currently studying 
        Computer Science and Data Science at George Mason University. I enjoy building projects that solve 
        real world problems - especially in areas like AI, data, and web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, organizing events, and diving into new technologies like machine learning, NLP, and system design to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to contribute meaningfully to teams focused on impactful technology, while always pushing myself to grow as an engineer.
